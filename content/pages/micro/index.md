# Micro Lucie

A workspace, a guest room surrounded by nature.
Located at the end of our land in [Kernevez, Berrien, France](https://goo.gl/maps/you3adP7U4ZacCU89).
I commute to it daily for work. This is where I drink coffee and make things happen.

At the end of a day, light comes in from the back and illuminate the place.
It is time to turn the wood oven on and serve yourself a nice drink to relax.
